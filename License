## Apache License 2.0 – Simplified Description

The **Apache License 2.0** is a **permissive open-source license** that allows users to freely use, modify, distribute, and even sell software — as long as they follow a few important rules.

### Key Highlights:

#### What You’re Allowed to Do:

* **Use** the software for personal, commercial, or educational purposes.
* **Modify** the source code to fit your needs.
* **Distribute** the original or modified version, including in proprietary projects.
* **Sublicense** or include it in larger projects.
* **Add warranties or paid support**, but only on your behalf.

#### Conditions You Must Follow:

1. **Include the License**: You must provide a copy of the Apache License with your distribution.
2. **State Your Changes**: If you modify any files, clearly mention that you did.
3. **Preserve Notices**: Keep any copyright, patent, or attribution notices in the source.
4. **Include the NOTICE File**: If the original project includes a `NOTICE` file, your version must too.
5. **Respect Trademarks**: You can’t use the original project's name or logo without permission.

#### Contributions:

Any code or content you contribute to an Apache-licensed project is automatically licensed under Apache 2.0 — unless you explicitly state otherwise.

#### Patents Clause:

If you sue someone over patent claims related to the software, your rights under this license are **revoked**.

#### No Warranty:

The software is provided **"as is"** — there's **no warranty** or guarantee that it will work as expected.

#### Liability:

Contributors are **not liable** for any damages, losses, or issues caused by using the software.

### How to Use It in Your Project:

Add this boilerplate at the top of your file or project:

### Summary

The Apache License 2.0 is ideal if you want:

* Freedom to use and modify the code.
* To protect your contributors.
* To keep your project open, while allowing for commercial use.

It’s widely used by major projects like **Apache Hadoop**, **Kubernetes**, **TensorFlow**, and more.
